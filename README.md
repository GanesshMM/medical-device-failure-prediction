# 🏥 Medical Equipment Failure Prediction 

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project develops a **real-time AI-driven predictive maintenance system** for critical medical devices using IoT telemetry and Azure cloud services. The system predicts equipment failures before they occur, enabling hospitals to proactively maintain devices, reduce operational downtime, minimize costs, and ultimately **save lives** through improved patient safety.

**Real-World Impact:** This solution can be deployed locally within hospital infrastructure to provide immediate alerts to maintenance teams, preventing costly equipment failures and ensuring continuous patient care.
