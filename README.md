# MedPredict AI - Medical Equipment Failure Prediction System

## Overview

MedPredict AI is a comprehensive cloud-based predictive maintenance solution for critical medical devices. The system leverages real-time IoT telemetry, advanced machine learning models, and modern web technologies to predict equipment failures before they occur, enabling proactive maintenance and improving hospital operational reliability.

## üè• Problem Statement

Healthcare facilities rely heavily on critical medical equipment such as ventilators, defibrillators, infusion pumps, and imaging devices. Unexpected equipment failures can:
- Compromise patient safety and care quality
- Lead to significant financial losses from downtime
- Cause operational disruptions in critical care environments
- Result in expensive emergency repairs and replacements

Traditional reactive maintenance approaches are insufficient for critical healthcare environments where equipment reliability is paramount.

## üéØ Solution

Our AI-powered predictive maintenance platform provides:
- **Real-time monitoring** of medical device health through IoT telemetry
- **Early failure prediction** using advanced machine learning models
- **Proactive maintenance alerts** to prevent unexpected downtime
- **Historical analytics** for long-term equipment management
- **Secure, compliant data storage** for healthcare environments
